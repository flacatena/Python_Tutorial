<h2  class="home_intro" > The setup stage prepares the Django web framework with all of the necessary directory structures and python files to start building web applications. Django requires Python and since different versions of Django are compatible with different versions of Python, it is recommend to build the applications in Django within a virtual environment which would include the compatible packages and dependencies needed for the specific versions desired. Virtual environments isolates different Django projects each with it's own set of package versions avoiding conflicts between projects or the operating system. Virtual environments also have additional benefits like security and organization.
Linux platforms like Ubuntu come with Python included in the sytem. If building a web application in Django requires a specific version that is different then the one that is included with the operating system, virtual environments make it possible to install different versions of Python as needed for the specific project without considering the version included on the operating system. There are different tools availble that make creating and managing virrtual environments easy. 
The methods listed below are the different ways to setup a Django project on a Ubuntu system using various different tools. The basic setup stage described in this tutorial follows the five procedures listed below, depending on the tools used there are other steps that are needed and are specific to the tools selected.
<br>
1) Update Ubuntu system packages.
<br>
2) Create and activate virtual environment.
<br>
3) Install Django.
<br>
4) Create Django project.
<br>
5) Create Django Applicaiton.
